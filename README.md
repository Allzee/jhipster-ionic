# JHipster-Ionic (Work in Progress)

This is attempt to show how to build an [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) app using [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) as backend

The project is structured in 2 modules:
- server: the JHipster backend
- mobile: the Ionic app

The guiding principle would be to generate the mobile app using Yeoman [Generator-M](https://github.com/mwaylabs/generator-m)
while following JHipster angular code conventions so that users feel at home.

If the prototype is successful, JHipster could be extended to generate CRUD screens for each entity in mobile app.

## Environment

- Ubuntu
- java 8
- node 0.12.4
- Android SDK

## Generating modules

### Server

    mkdir server
    cd server
    yo jhipster

I chose the default options except for:

- gradle to be consistent with Android and [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- gulp to be consistent with Generator-M and Ionic
- no translation

Test that app works:

    ./gradlew bootRun

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080

### Mobile App

The Ionic app was generated by Yeoman Generator-M

    mkdir mobile
    cd mobile
    yo m

I chose the default options except for:

- appName: "jhipsterApp" to be consistent with JHipster angular module
- appId: "com.mycompany.myapp" to be consistent with JHipster
- no i18n/l10n
- no iOS

Test that app works in browser:

    gulp watch

Open http://127.0.0.1:9000

## Differences in angular projects

### Project structure

- JHipster: organized by feature, a folder can contain a state, a controller and a template. Generic components (filters, directives, services) are stored in 'components' folder.
- Generator-M: organized by module and type, all states are defined in one file per module (e.g. main.js)

### Modules

- JHipster: single module
- Generator-M: Multi modules but at least app and main

### Naming conventions

- JHipster: MainController defined in main.controller.js
- Generator-M: MainCtrl defined in main-ctrl.js
