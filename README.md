# JHipster-Ionic

Example showing how to build an [Ionic] app using  [JHipster] as backend

The project is structured in 2 modules:
- server: the JHipster backend
- client: the Ionic app

## Environment

- Ubuntu
- java 8
- node 0.12.4
- Android SDK

## Generating modules

### Server

    mkdir server
    cd server
    yo jhipster

I chose the default options except for:

- gradle to be consistent with Android and [Apache Cordova]
- gulp to be consistent with [M-generator] and Ionic
- no translation

Test that app works:

    ./gradlew bootRun

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080

### Client

The Ionic was generated by Yeoman [M-generator]

    mkdir client
    cd client
    yo m

I chose the default options except for:

- no i18n/l10n
- no iOS

Test that app works in browser:

    gulp watch
